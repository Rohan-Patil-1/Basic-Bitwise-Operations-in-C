# Basic-Bitwise-Operations-in-C

This repository is for pratice of basic Bitwise operations in C lanugage using operators and avoiding pre-built functions or libraries. Their are certains rules and constraints on which operators are legal or not for particular function. 

The basic code is already been written by me, any user needs to work on TO-DO or fill in correct operators logically and then compile for cross validation.

ALL THE BEST
